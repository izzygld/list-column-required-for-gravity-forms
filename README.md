# List Column Required for Gravity Forms

A Gravity Forms add-on that lets you mark individual columns as **required** in multi-column List fields — something Gravity Forms doesn't support out of the box.

By default, Gravity Forms only allows you to make the entire List field required (meaning at least one row must be filled). This plugin goes further: you can choose **which columns** within each row must be filled in before the form can be submitted.

## The Problem

When using the Gravity Forms **List** field with "Enable multiple columns" turned on, there's no way to require specific columns. You can only require the entire field, which passes as long as *any* cell has a value — even if critical columns like "Email" or "Name" are left blank.

## The Solution

This add-on adds a small **"Required"** checkbox next to each column in the form editor. Check it, and that column becomes required — with server-side validation, front-end asterisk indicators, and accessible `aria-required` attributes.

## Screenshots

### Form Editor (Backend)

Each column gets a "Required" checkbox. The label turns red when checked so it's easy to spot at a glance.

### Front-End Form

Required columns display an asterisk (**\***) in the column header, matching Gravity Forms' native required field styling.

## How It Works

| Layer | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Form Editor** | A "Required" checkbox is injected next to each column via GF's `gform_append_field_choice_option_list` JS callback. The `isColumnRequired` flag is stored on each choice object and saved automatically with the form JSON. |
| **Auto-Require All** | When the main field-level "Required" rule is toggled ON, all columns are automatically marked as required too. You can then uncheck individual columns if needed. Toggling the field-level rule OFF does *not* clear column-level required flags. |
| **Server Validation** | On submission, the `gform_field_validation` filter checks every row. If a row has any data at all, all required columns in that row must be filled. If all rows are empty, the first row is still validated — required columns mean "you gotta fill this in." |
| **Front-End Rendering** | The `gform_field_content` filter adds a red asterisk to required column headers. The `gform_column_input_content` filter adds `aria-required="true"` to inputs for accessibility. |

### Validation Logic

- **Row with some data** → all required columns in that row must be filled
- **All rows empty** → the first row's required columns are enforced
- **Extra blank rows** → skipped (user added a row but didn't start filling it)
- **Non-column List fields** → completely unaffected

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.8+
- PHP 7.4+
- Gravity Forms 2.5+

## Installation

1. Copy the `list-column-required-for-gravity-forms` folder into your `wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin in WordPress admin → Plugins
3. Edit any form with a List field → enable multiple columns → check "Required" on the columns you want

No configuration pages or global settings needed — it just works at the field level.

## Hooks Used

| Hook | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `gform_loaded` | Action | Bootstrap the addon when GF is ready |
| `gform_field_validation` | Filter | Server-side per-column required validation |
| `gform_column_input_content` | Filter | Add `aria-required` to required column inputs |
| `gform_field_content` | Filter | Add asterisk to required column headers |

## Developer Notes

- Column required state is stored as `isColumnRequired` (boolean) on each choice object in `$field->choices[]`
- Property name deliberately avoids `isRequired` to prevent conflict with the field-level required flag
- No new database tables — everything lives in the existing form JSON
- The JS uses `window["gform_append_field_choice_option_list"]` — a type-specific callback called by GF's `GetFieldChoices()` function
